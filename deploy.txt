->The lxd-demo-server is a daemon that offers a public REST API for use from a web browser.
->Root shell using a LXD container with nesting enabled.
->Recording all sessions in a sqlite3 database.
->Network side of things, the demo server itself doesn’t do any kind of firewalling or similar network restrictions.
